 * Make simple payments to beneficiaries

 * making a payment.
 *

 *
 * 1. Check how much money you hold in various foreign currencies.
 * 2. Use funds from your Euros balance to make a payment in Euros to a beneficiary in Germany.

 *
 * b. Priority payments: Made using the SWIFT network. Payments can be made to over 212 countries, and 95% of payments
 * arrive within one working day.
 *
 * You want to make a regular payment to a supplier based in Germany. You will pay the beneficiary in Euros. You have
 * enough funds in your Euros balance already to make this payment, so there is no need to top-up your Euros balance
 * beforehand.
 *
 * First, check what details are required to make a regular payment in Euros to a beneficiary with a bank account in
 * Germany. To do that, call the Get Beneficiary Requirements endpoint.
